# Football Output Prediction

Predicting football outcomes using machine learning algorithms based on historical data, team performance, player statistics, and other relevant features.

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the outcomes of football matches (Win, Loss, or Draw) by leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques. The model considers various factors such as team statistics, player performance, historical match data, and other features to generate predictions.

---

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the football dataset for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing team statistics, player performance, and match outcomes.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of algorithms such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
- **Outcome Prediction**: Predict the result of a football match based on input features.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/football-output-prediction.git
   cd football-output-prediction
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Preprocess the dataset:
   - Run the data preprocessing script to clean and transform the data.

   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```

2. Train the model:
   - Train the machine learning models and evaluate their performance.

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. Predict match outcomes:
   - Use the trained model to predict outcomes for new matches.

   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

- **Accuracy**: X%
- **Precision**: X%
- **Recall**: X%
- **F1 Score**: X%

---

## Visualization

Some of the visualizations created during EDA include:

- Win/Loss/Draw distribution
- Goals scored by Home and Away teams
- Team performance trends over time

---

## Future Improvements

- Include more features such as weather conditions, player injuries, and form.
- Implement deep learning models for improved predictions.
- Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
